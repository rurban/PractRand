/*
Things to configure in this file:
1.  endianness (usually CPU dependent, sometimes OS dependent)
2.  thread-local-storage (usually compiler dependent)
3.  integer types (compiler and CPU dependent)

1.  Endianness:
	The choices are little-endian and big-endian.  x86 CPUs are little-endian, 
as are ARM, ALPHA, and IA64/Itanium.  MIPs CPUs are big-endian, as are Sparcs, 
PA-RISC, 68k, and almost all PPC and Power.  
	See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness for more information.  
	PractRand does not care about endianness for floating point values, only 
for integer values, so if your CPU and FPU are at odds, go with the CPU.  
	Exactly one of the two endiannesses must be defined or PractRand will not 
compile.  If the wrong one is defined then PractRand will mostly still work, 
though some kinds of things (particularly serialization) may not work 
precisely as intended, and if PractRands self-test function is called then it 
may report an endianness error.  

2.  Thread-local-storage aka TLS
	On Microsoft compilers define this as __declspec(thread).  On gcc it 
should be __thread instead.  Borland and Intel C++ can use either.  
	See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage for more 
information.  
	If your compiler does not support TLS or supports TLS by an interface 
that is not compatible with PractRand then you can leave this one 
undefined.  PractRand autoseeding will not work as well in multithreaded 
programs, but it will still work.  

3.  Integer type sizes
	If you know C/C++ program this one should be self-explanatory.  The 
default configuration should work for most 32 bit and 64 bit platforms.  
If you are on a 16 bit or 8 bit platform then you will have to 
reconfigure it.  PractRand does not use the C99 standard for this because 
that is not yet standard for C++ (soon...), and some compilers I use do 
not yet include the C99 integer size headers.  
	If your compiler does not support 64 bit integers then PractRand can 
not be built at all - many many things in PractRand require them.  
	If this section is misconfigured then PractRand should fail to 
compile with error messages about _compiletime_assert_integer_size.
