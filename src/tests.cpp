		if you draw a graph with x=log(p) and y=sample(p) (where high p is defined to correspond to high samples for this purpose):
			the far left side should tend towards increasing slope (more vertical)
		if you draw a graph with x=log(1-p) and y=sample(1-p):
			the far left side should tend towards increasingly negative slope (more vertical)
		if you draw a graph with x=p and y=sample(p) the middle of the graph should mostly look contiguous
