It looks like quality is suffering with 4 bit words... 
	one possibly is how few shift constants are possible... maybe they all suck

Some oddities related to empirical quality vs parameterization visible there at 4 bit
	impossible to tell if they remain at 8 bit

/*	on the algorithm:
		examining small windows of the output is never sufficient to learn anything significant, 
			due to relatively large FIFO "iteration_table"
		examining small windows at a stride of ITERATION_SIZE apart might be sufficient, but...
			if the indirection pattern is not predicted/guessed that is meaningless
			if the indirection pattern is predicted/guessed, 
				if it doesn't reach back ITERATION_SIZE elements
					that will simply add more unknowns
				if it does reach back ITERATION_SIZE elements
					you still need to establish the contents of (a,b,c)
					and besides that's an enormous amount of indirection pattern to figure out
		figuring out any significant portion of the indirection pattern should be very very difficult
	consider:
		if we guess (a,b,c,i) and "indirect" correctly (a LOT of correct guesses)
		then we can use all that to calculate "iterated" from the output
		and then use all that plus a guess that the indirection index is identical
			(which isn't exactly a guess since that's a function of other values we guessed, but it doesn't happen all that often)
		to figure out all the same information at the next position
		it might look like we have it almost cracked - we can predict important future (partial) states with relatively high probabilities
		but that's useless if we can't TELL if our guesses were right
		1. 
			which we can't do from a short output window
				because we need the output to figure out "iterated" values feeding in
			so we keep guessing that the indirection index remains constant, ITERATIONS_SIZE times in a row
			THEN we can start to confirm our guesses
			but that's already on the order of 2**(W*5+ITERATION_SIZE*L) operations to get a success
			W is word size, in bits; L is log2(INDIRECTION_SIZE)
		2. 
			which we can't do from a single short output window
			...so we have to skip forward roughly ITERATION_SIZE positions to a 2nd window
			and do the whole thing over again (but we don't have to guess "i" again)
			and use the old predicted values of "indirect" fed in to the iteration table
			to check the new predicted values of "iterated"
			and then we can START confirming our guesses
			at region1 we guessed (a,b,c) and "i" and "indirect"
			at region2 we guessed (a,b,c) and "indirect"
		3. 
			we check if the "iterated" values observed actually match the constant-indirection-index required
			but even if they appear to, that doesn't do us much good, as it's still far more likely to be a false positive than a true positive
			unless they appear to for a very long sequence... but the chances of such a region even existing in a cyphertext length <2**64 is very small
	overall, I think the 32 bit word variant ought to be good for 128 bit security, and the 64 bit word variant ought to be good for 160 bit security
	I don't have much confidence in the 8 or 16 bit variants though
