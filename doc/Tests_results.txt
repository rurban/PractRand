Times are very rough figures based upon modern desktop x86 CPUs, but using only one core (no multithreading).  
(times were fairly similar on a variety of such CPUs, including 3 GHz Core 2s and Core i5s)

Note that some categories were omitted - candidate RNGs were not counted, 
nor were "Transforms applied to various low quality RNGs".  

PractRand std:
	The standard test battery of PractRand.  
	The only test suite to offer interim / progressive results.  
	The only test suite to allow very long tests.  
	caveats:
		Requires more bits to find bias than any other test suite (of those listed).  
		May be cheating slightly on the LCGs - it often runs out the periods on those instead of finding bias the normal way.  
		Multithreading is supported, but max speedup tends to be limited to about 3x.  
	vs time:
		10 seconds: PractRand standard 512 MB
		1 minute:   PractRand standard 4 GB
		5 minutes:  PractRand standard 16 GB
		30 minutes: PractRand standard 128 GB
		4 hours:    PractRand standard 4 TB

TestU01 *Crush:
	Meaning SmallCrush, Crush, and BigCrush from TestU01.  
	The only test suite (of those listed) with a big name academic in the field behind it.  
	caveats:
		More sensitive to RNG speed than the other test suites (of those listed) at default settings.  
		Does not support multithreading.  
	vs time:
		10 seconds: SmallCrush
		1 minute:   -- (used SmallCrush)
		5 minutes:  -- (used SmallCrush)
		30 minutes: Crush
		4 hours:    BigCrush

RaBiGeTe ext:
	The "extended" preset of RaBiGeTe, but with DFT disabled.  
	(DFT wasn't adding anything to the results and was preventing longer tests from working)
	Can find bias in many RNGs using fewer bits than the other test suites.  
	Supports multithreading better than the other test suites (of those listed).  
	caveats:
		Tended to crash a bit.  
		I was using a pre-release version - the released versions at the time had some issues.  
		I had to ignore the authors instructions and make up my own to get clear & correct results.  
		The recent versions seem to be GUI-only, making it harder to automate.  
		The "30 minute" results actually took about 40 minutes... I was kinda generous there.  
	vs time:
		10 seconds: RaBiGeTe extended 2 Mb
		1 minute:   RaBiGeTe extended 16 Mb
		5 minutes:  RaBiGeTe extended 64 Mb
		30 minutes: RaBiGeTe extended 512 Mb (actually took about 40 minutes)
		4 hours:    -- (used RaBiGeTe extended 512 Mb)

Dieharder:
	The normal "-a" option produced very bad results (few biases found, several false positives) and was disqualified.  
	A custom set of parameters emphasizing the "dab" tests worked better, but I don't have full results at this time.

*****************************************************************************
3. Details of the results format
*****************************************************************************

columns:
	RNG
		The name of the RNG algorithm used;
		The name used is the name it is called in PractRand, not necessarily 
		its real full name - for instance, hc256 instead of HC-256.  
	PractRand standard
		The PractRand standard tests are those returned by 
		PractRand::Tests::Batteries::get_standard_tests().  
		quirks:
			test set is (slightly) dependent upon RNG metadata
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer (in single-threaded mode):
			1 GB: ~15 seconds
			1 TB: ~4 hours
		format:
			The length of sequence required for the PractRand standard tests 
			to detect bias.  If multiple seeds were tested, and bias was 
			found in them at different sequence lengths, then the median 
			result is used.  If bias was not found then the length of the 
			longest sequence tested is recorded, with a ">" prefixed in 
			front of it.  
			Bias is considered to have been found when the standard tool 
			rates the result as "FAIL" (with or without exclamation marks).  
			(p-value threshold vary with circumstances but are typically 
			near 1e-10 on the low side and 1 - 1e-10 on the high side)
			The length is recorded as a number followed by KB, MB, GB, or 
			TB.  Those stand for kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, or terabyte 
			respectively.  
			All lengths are rounded up to the nearest power of 2.  
	TestU01 *Crush
		This refers to the batteries "SmallCrush", "Crush", and "BigCrush" 
		in TestU01.
		quirks:
			does not accept a sequence length parameter
			works on RNGs outputing 31 bits per call:
				on 32 bit RNGs it works but disregards the lowest bit?!?
				on 8/16 bit RNGs, I concatonate multiple outputs together to produce a 32 bit output
				on 64 bit RNGs... I am currently discarding the upper 32 bits to produce a 32 bit output
					might, in the future, change that to returning half and buffering half for the next call
			does not print any results until all are ready
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer:
			SmallCrush: ~8 seconds
			Crush:      ~30 minutes
			BigCrush:   ~4 hours
		format:
			If all 3 are passed then the result is recorded as "pass".  
			Otherwise, the result is recorded as X/Y/Z, where X is the 
			number of tests failed in SmallCrush, Y is the number failed in 
			Crush, and Z is the number failed in BigCrush.  
			Failure is defined as a p-value <= 1.0e-10 or >= (1 - 1.0e-10)
	RaBiGeTe extended
		This refers to the preset testing parameters named "extended", but see the quirks section.  
		quirks:
			In order to get 512 Mb samples to run on extended I had to disable the DFT test
			I used a more recent version of RaBiGeTe that has not been publicly released at this time.  
			I used RaBiGeTe in a slightly non-standard way, testing single long samples instead of many short samples.  
				In my testing this method worked much better than the recommended way.  
			It crashed several times during testing.  
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer:
			16 Mb: just over 1 minute
			512 Mb: a little under 40 minutes
		format:
			The same format was used as for PractRand standard, with three exceptions.  
			A result was considered a failure if any p-value was <= 1e-10, or if 5 or 
			more p-values were <= 0.000001 or >= 0.999999, or if any p-values were 
			omitted from the results.  I never consider a single p-value close to one  
			a failure in RaBiGeTe even if it is exactly 1.0.  
			The second exception is that lengths are listed in bits instead of bytes.  
			The third exception is that if an RNG passed 512 megabits of testing then it was listed as "pass".  
				... because RaBiGeTe was unable to test sequences longer than 512 Mb on the settings I used.  

	If a result is listed as "?" that means that that test has not been run 
	on that RNG.  If a result has a normal value followed by a "?" that 
	means that either that result is strongly implied by tests on nearly 
	equivalent RNGs, or that the test was run and is believed to have 
	produced that result but the record-keeping involved was incomplete and 
	I can't be sure without re-running the test.  


*****************************************************************************
4. Tests that were not included
*****************************************************************************

tests that were not included:
	PractRand expanded standard
		This test battery was not used because:
			A. It significantly underperforms PractRand standard on fast RNGs.  
			B. If I listed its test results here I'd have to update them 
				every time I added a new test to it.  
	TestU01 Rabbit
		This test battery was not used because:
			A. It consistently crashes if used on a long sequence
			B. Its time to complete a test does not increase linearly with 
				sequence length - in some cases it actually decreases with 
				length.  This appears to be partially caused by the test 
				set being a function of the testing length.  
			C. Its results do not seem to improve in power with sequence 
				length consistently enough.  
	TestU01 Pseudo-diehard
		This test battery was not used because it is too low quality.  
	NIST RNG tests
		???
		This test battery was not used because:
			A. The currently released code is incapable of multiple test 
				runs on RNGs linked with it in a single run, making 
				administering the tests somewhat difficult.  
	Dieharder
		default set of tests (-a)
			Not used because it was too inefficient.  
			And because it has too many false positives
		custom test set (using just dab_monobit2 and dab_dct)
			Would consider using, but I don't have enough results yet.  
			Also, the maximum number of bits is too low.
