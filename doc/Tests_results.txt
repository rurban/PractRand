columns:
	RNG
		The name of the RNG algorithm used;
		The name used is the name it is called in PractRand, not necessarily 
		its real full name - for instance, hc256 instead of HC-256.  
	PractRand standard
		The PractRand standard tests are those returned by 
		PractRand::Tests::Batteries::get_standard_tests().  
		quirks:
			test set is (slightly) dependent upon RNG metadata
			p-values are *very* crudely aproximated
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer:
			1 GB: ~15 seconds
			1 TB: ~4 hours
		format:
			The length of sequence required for the PractRand standard tests 
			to detect bias.  If multiple seeds were tested, and bias was 
			found in them at different sequence lengths, then the median 
			result is used.  If bias was not found then the length of the 
			longest sequence tested is recorded, with a ">" prefixed in 
			front of it.  
			Bias is considered to have been found when the p-value 
			approaches zero or one to within 1.0e-10.  
			The length is recorded as a number followed by KB, MB, GB, or 
			TB.  Those stand for kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, or terabyte 
			respectively.  
			All lengths are rounded up to the nearest power of 2.  
	TestU01 *Crush
		This refers to the batteries "SmallCrush", "Crush", and "BigCrush" 
		in TestU01.
		quirks:
			does not accept a sequence length parameter
			works on RNGs outputing 31 bits per call:
				on 32 bit RNGs it works but disregards the lowest bit
				on 8/16 bit RNGs, I concatonate multiple outputs together to produce a 32 bit output
				on 64 bit RNGs... I am currently discarding the upper 32 bits to produce a 32 bit output
					might, in the future, change that to returning half and buffering half for the next call
			does not print any results until all are ready
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer:
			SmallCrush: 9 seconds
			Crush:      40 minutes
			BigCrush:   5 hours
		format:
			If all 3 are passed then the result is recorded as "pass".  
			Otherwise, the result is recorded as X/Y/Z, where X is the 
			number of tests failed in SmallCrush, Y is the number failed in 
			Crush, and Z is the number failed in BigCrush.  
			Failure is defined as a p-value <= 1.0e-10 or >= (1 - 1.0e-10)
	
	If a result is listed as "?" that means that that test has not been run 
	on that RNG.  If a result has a normal value followed by a "?" that 
	means that either that result is strongly implied by tests on nearly 
	equivalent RNGs, or that the test was run and is believed to have 
	produced that result but the record-keeping involved was incomplete and 
	I can't be sure without re-running the test.  


*****************************************************************************

tests that were not included:
	PractRand expanded standard
		This test was not used because:
			p-values are unavailable on most tests, justs pass/fail results
	TestU01 Rabbit
		This test was not used because:
			A. It consistently crashes if used on a long sequence
			B. Its time to complete a test does not increase linearly with 
				sequence length - in some cases it actually decreases with 
				length.  This appears to be partially caused by the test 
				set being a function of the testing length.  
			C. Its results do not seem to improve in power with sequence 
				length consistently enough.  
	TestU01 Pseudo-diehard
		This test was not used because it is too low quality.  
	NIST RNG tests
		???
	RaBiGeTe, default configuration
		This test was not used because:
			A. The currently released code is incapable of multiple test 
				runs on RNGs linked with it in a single run, making 
				administering the tests somewhat difficult.
