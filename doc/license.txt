I, Chris Doty-Humphrey, release all of my work on PractRand to the 
public domain.  

All statistical tests in PractRand are wholly my own work, and are 
public domain.  

All the auxillary code, including the example program, is by myself 
and thus public domain.  

All of the recommended RNGs are unencumbered:
	jsf* was designed by Robert Jenkins, and he has released it to 
	the public domain.  The implementation is mostly his code with a 
	little of my own.  

	isaac* was designed by Robert Jenkins, and he has released it to 
	the public domain.  The implementation is mostly his code with a 
	little of my own.  

	sfc* was designed and coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	efiix* was designed and coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	hc256: "The stream ciphers HC-128 and HC-256 are not patented and 
	are royalty free. Anyone can use HC-128 and HC-256 free of charge."
	I started with the reference implementation and modified it slightly.  

	mt19937 is an unencumbered algorithm.  The implementation was coded 
	by myself, and is public domain.  

	trivium: "To the author's knowledge Trivium is not covered by any 
	patent. Trivium is also free available for any use."

	xsm* was written by myself, incorporating some ideas from svfuerst on 
	usenet comp.lang.asm.x86, and is public domain.  

The "NotRecommended" RNGs included in the full version... are more 
numerous, and less important, since they mostly are not intended to 
actually ship with any real product.  The code for them was either 
written by myself or copied from a publicly accessible web page, forum 
post, paper, or book.
