I release all of my work on PractRand to the public domain.  

All statistical tests in PractRand are wholly my own work, and 
are public domain.  

All the auxillary code is by myself and thus public domain.  

For the other RNGs...

mwlac* is designed and coded by myself, and thus public domain.  

efiix* is designed and coded by myself, and thus public domain.  

isaac* is designed by Robert Jenkins, and he has released it to 
the public domain.  The implementation is mostly his code with a 
little of my own.  

jsf* is designed by Robert Jenkins.  I believe that he intended 
to release it to the public domain, but I'll have to double-check 
that.  

hc256 is an unencumbered algorithm.  The code is a mix of the 
reference code and my own code.  I'm afraid I can't recall if the 
reference code was public domain or what, I'll have to double-check.  
See the eStream project for more details on HC-256 and HC-128.  

lcg64_32 is an unencumbered algorithm.  The implementation was 
coded by myself, and is thus public domain.  

clcg96_32 is an unencumbered algorithm.  The implementation was 
coded by myself, and is thus public domain.  

mt19937 is an unencumbered algorithm (though it wasn't always IIRC).  
The implementation was mostly coded by... I do not recall.  I'll 
have to look around a bit.
