PractRand (Practically Random) is a C++ library of pseudo-random number 
generators (PRNGs, or just RNGs) and statistical tests for RNGs.  

version 0.80

1. Randon Number Generation in PractRand

features:

A. Very convenient interface for practical use, not just research.  
B. A variety of very high quality RNG algorithms optimized for 
several different scenarios.  
C. Common interface available for a variety of RNG algorithms, 
making switching underlying algorithms trivial.  

Other libraries including multiple RNG algorithms:
Boost / C++0x TR1 - http://www.boost.org/
TestU01 - http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~simardr/testu01/tu01.html

GSL - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

2. Statistical testing of RNGs

features:

A. Includes a standard battery of tests, in the tradition of Diehard 
and TestU01 Crush / BigCrush.  
B. Standard battery of tests can detect bias in a wide variety of RNGs 
quickly.  
C. Tests are provided as legally unencumbered source code and static 
libraries, so that data can be passed directly to them bypassing the 
hard disk speed and size limitations.

RNG_interface_variations.txt - while PractRand offers a common interface 
	to all RNGs in it, there are actually several minor variations on 
	that common interface, ie polymorphic RNGs vs light-weight RNGs.  
RNG_entropy_pools.txt - not yet written
Tests.txt - brief discusion of how to use the statitical tests... 
	examining the sample program is probably more useful in that regard.
