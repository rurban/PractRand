PractRand (Practically Random) is a C++ library of pseudo-random number 
generators (PRNGs, or just RNGs) and statistical tests for RNGs.  

version 0.84

1. Randon Number Generation with PractRand
Most development platforms come with random number generators that have 
major statistical flaws, are a bit slow, and/or have inconvenient 
interfaces.  PractRand can help.  

features:

A. Very convenient interface for practical use, not just research.  

A1: Abstraction layer hides details of the RNG algorithms native output 
format, as users have better things to worry about.  
A2: Natively supports uniform integer and floating point distributions, 
compatible with the more complex distributions offered by Boost / C++0x TR1.  
A3: Common interface available for a variety of RNG algorithms, making 
switching underlying algorithms trivial.  
A4: Automatic seeding, or seeding from any type(s) you want, with a simple 
seeding interface for the common cases and powerful seeding helper objects 
for exotic cases.  

B. A variety of very high quality RNG algorithms optimized for 
several different scenarios.  

B1: Lists of RNG algorithms and their strengths, to make it easy to find 
one appropriate for specific circumstances quickly.  
B2: RNG algorithms that pass all statistical tests easily.  
B3: RNG algorithms that are very fast.  
B4: RNG algorithms that are cryptographically secure.  
B5: RNG algorithms that are easy to implement in hardware.  
B6: RNG algorithms that allow seeking / random access.  
B7: RNG algorithms appropriate for just about any type of CPU (except 
floating point DSPs... will add some for those later).

2. Statistical testing of RNGs with PractRand

features:

A. Includes a standard battery of tests, in the tradition of Diehard.  

B. Standard battery of tests can detect bias in a wide variety of RNGs 
quickly.  See Tests_results.txt and/or Tests_engines.txt for more on 
which biases it can detect how quickly relative to competing software 
packages.  Basically, it can detect ~90% of biases that competing 
software packages can detect, plus several categories of bias that 
competitors cannot detect or have a very hard time detecting.  On 
biases it can detect it is broadly comparable in speed (sometimes 
slower, sometimes faster, but generally similar) to competitors, but 
requires more bits.  

C. Tests are provided as legally unencumbered source code and static 
libraries, so that data can be passed directly to them bypassing the 
hard disk speed and size limitations.  To the best of my knowledge 
PractRand is the *only* such software package (most competitors are 
not intended to be linked with, and even those that are have license 
restrictions on what they can be linked with and redistributed with).  

D. No realistic maximum sequence length for testing.  Competing 
software packages generally either have an interface that makes long 
sequences impossible or crash if given a very long sequence, but 
PractRand has been tested on sequence lengths over 100 terabytes and 
is expected to work on sequence lengths up to a few exabytes.  

E. Mostly original tests.  Competing software packages tend to mainly 
use duplicates of tests that appeared in the literature decades ago, 
with only a few unusual tests.  There is nothing wrong with that, but 
it means that if you are testing with at least two test suites then 
you are likely to have less redundancy (and better breadth) if one of 
the test suites is PractRand.  

F. PractRands testing interface allows preliminary results to be 
requested at any time without having to start the testing over again.  
Most competitors require that results be evaluated just once at the 
end of a test.  If you are testing an RNG using dynamic test sequence 
lengths - progressively longer until the RNG fails a test - then this 
is a very important feature.
