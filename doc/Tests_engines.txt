Specific Tests in PractRand:
Recommended tests:
	BCFN - checks for long range linear correlations (bit counting);
		in practice this often detects Fibonacci style RNGs that 
		rely upon large lags to defeat other statistical tests.  
		Two integer parameters are used - the first is the minimum 
		"level" it checks for bias at (it checks all higher levels 
		that it has enough data for), higher values are faster but 
		can miss shorter range correlations.  The recommended 
		minimum level is 2, as that helps it skip the slowest parts 
		and avoids redundancy with DC6 checking for the shortest 
		range linear correlations, while still doing a reasonable 
		amount of work for how much memory it has to scan.  
		The second integer parameter helps determine the amount 
		of memory and cache it will use in testing.  It is the 
		log-base-2 of the size of the tables it uses internally.  
		Recommended values are 10 to 15, larger values if cache is 
		large, lower values if cache is small.  
	DC6 - checks for short range linear correlations (bit counting); 
		takes several parameters that determine the size of 
		integers it operates on internally, the number of adjacent 
		such integers it looks for correlations between, and which 
		information it uses for each such integer; for recommended 
		values see the code for get_core_tests() and 
		get_expanded_core_tests() in test_batteries.cpp.  
	Gap16 - A variation on the classic "Gap" test.  No parameters 
		are needed.  
Transforms:
	(these appear as tests but are simply wrappers for other tests)
	multiplex - simply routes operations on this test to multiple 
		subtests
	lowbits - for each 1,2,4,or 8 bytes this takes the lowest 1,2,4,8,16, 
		or 32 bits and routes them to the wrapped tests)
	shrink - 
	FirstNofM - 
	BWT - 
Non-recommended tests:
	FPF - "floating point frequency" test; contrary to the name 
		it's purely integer math.  Can be very slow on some settings.  
		Tends to not be very good, but for RNGs that have short range 
		patterns that do not line up with byte boundaries it can do 
		better than the other tests sometimes.  
	CoupGap - "Coupon / Gap hybrid" test; still in development;
		behavior is similar to most gap tests
	...many more still to come
