Specific Tests in PractRand:
	Recommended tests:
		Gap16 - a variation of the classic "Gap" test
		BCFN - checks for long range linear correlations;
			in practice this often detects Fibonacci style RNGs that 
			rely upon large lags to defeat other statistical tests
		DC6 - checks for short range linear correlations
	Transforms:
		(these appear as tests but are simply wrappers for other tests)
		multiplex - simply routes operations on this test to multiple 
			subtests
		lowbits - for each 1,2,4,or 8 bytes this takes the lowest 1,2,4,8,16, 
			or 32 bits and routes them to the wrapped tests)
		shrink - 
		FirstNofM - 
	Non-recommended tests:
		FPF - "floating point frequency" test; contrary to the name 
			it's purely integer math.  Can be very slow on some settings.  
			Tends to not be very good.  
		CoupGap - "Coupon / Gap hybrid" test; still in development;
			behavior is similar to most gap tests
		...many more still to come
