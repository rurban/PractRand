Not much documentation yet, hopefully that will get fixed in the 
next version.  The test program shows off testing on a simple 
RNG though.  

Tests:
	Gap16 - a simple 16 bit gap test
	BCFN - checks for long range linear correlations;
		in practice this often detects Fibonacci style RNGs that 
		rely upon large lags to defeat other statistical tests
	DC6 - checks for short range linear correlations
	Transforms:
		(these appear as tests but are simply wrappers for other tests)
		multiplex - simply routes operations on this test to multiple subtests
		lowbits - for each 1,2,4,or 8 bytes this takes the lowest 1,2,4,8,16, 
			or 32 bits and routes them to the wrapped tests)
