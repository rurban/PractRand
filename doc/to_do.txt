post-initial-release:
	figure out where the giant size for the .lib files is coming from
	add compatibility with C++0x TR1 RNG distributions
	double-check licenses/patents on RNG algorithms & code
	add self-tests, regression tests, etc
	test program
		add multithreading (using SDL?  or maybe native WIN32?)
	choices in library to be reconsidered:
		names of randlf, randli
		ranges to randf, randi, randlf, randli: [min..max) or [min..max]
		should unseeded RNGs require explicit SEED_NONE flag?
		should rename vRNG to PolymorphicRNG?
		change return type of RNG::get_name to something that doesn't require STL (ie write to buffer)?
		should split add_entropy* methods off from vRNG in to a new child class?
		???
	improvements to example program(s)
		multithreading testing
	put together chart showing which RNGs fail which tests when
		RNGs on list should include various qualities in each category:
			simple w/o multiplication
				bin48_16, sapparot, ...
			simple w/ multiplication
				lcg32_16, lcg48_16, cmwc, ...
			cyclic buffer
				mm, lfsr?, mwc4691, ...
			indirection
				rc4_weakened, ibaa8x4, ibaa16x4, rc4, isaac32x16
			special
				icg32_16, ???
