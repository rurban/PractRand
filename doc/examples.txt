PractRand example programs:
1a. test
	Applies the PractRand standard suite of statistical tests to an RNG.  The RNG is specified at compile time atm.  
1b. multithreaded_test
	As test, but using multiple threads.  
2. RNG_output
	Takes an RNG name and number of bytes on the command line, prints that many raw bytes of random numbers.  
	For use in unix-like environments where the output might be piped somewhere useful.  
3. RNG_benchmark
	measures speeds of all recommended RNGs and all candidate RNGs
