version 0.86
	RNGs algorithms:
		changes to specific RNGs:
			jsf16
				it was using the wrong shifts for some reason, fixed
				(that should improve quality)
			efiix8x384, efiix16x384, efiix32x384, efiix64x384
				tweaked seeding algorithm to improve speed
			trivium
				fixed bugs
				improved validation
	test programs:
		new test programs:
			Multithreaded RNG test
				like the old RNG_test, but uses multiple threads.  
				currently it likes to use about 5 threads total on the standard test set
				(1 for the RNG, 1 for each core test, 1 for all the extra foldings)
				but it doesn't keep those occupied all the time
				it has a bad habit of recreating its threads frequently instead of keeping a pool of workers

version 0.85
	fixed various issues preventing compilation on recent versions of gcc
		tested on gcc 4.6.1
	improved portability
		no config.h changes needed now when switching between the most common compilers
	RNG interfaces:
		light-weight RNGs:
			namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs -> PractRand::RNGs::LightWeight
			now available for all RNGs
			now defaults to using templates to implement light-weight RNGs
			can be disabled by defining PRACTRAND_NO_LIGHT_WEIGHT_RNGS
				(definition must occur prior to the #include of PractRand headers)
		polymorphic RNGs:
			fixed lack of virtual destructor (oops!)
		entropy pooling RNGs:
			namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic
			namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Raw::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Raw
		serialization:
			Polymorphic RNGs now have serialization & deserialization methods
			other RNGs can be serialized as well, but no convenient interface atm
		random access aka seeking:
			now allows 128 bit seek distances (passed as two 64 bit numbers)
		Boost / C++0x TR1 compatibility:
			now ONLY available if PRACTRAND_BOOST_COMPATIBILITY is defined
				(must be defined before PractRand headers are included)
			now available on base class vRNG in addition to vRNG8/vRNG16/vRNG32/vRNG64
	RNGs algorithms:
		new algorithms:
			trivium
				*NOT ENABLED YET* (it's failing validation atm)
				all previous crypto RNG in PractRand were large-state indirection-based RNGs
				so I added a small-state non-indirection-based crypto RNG
				unfortunately it is somewhat slow
			xsm64
				the old random access algorithms (lcg64_32 and clcg96_32) sucked
				xsm64 is intended to replace clcg96_32
				like clcg96_32 it uses 64 bit math internally
				but unlike clcg96_32 it outputs a full 64 bits, not 32 bits
				and unlike clcg96_32 it is acceptable for parallel uses
			xsm32
				the old random access algorithms (lcg64_32 and lcg96_32) sucked
				xsm32 is intended to replace lcg64_32
				it is not as fast, but comparable on 32 bit CPUs
				and has significantly better quality and statespace
				in particular, 
		changes to specific RNGs:
			sha2_based_pool
				fixed a bug that could produce crashes
				now in the PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic namespace instead of PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic::EntropyPools
			arbee
				changed input mixing algorithm; flush_buffers() now meaningful
				namespace changed (see RNG category changes)
				namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic
				namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Raw::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Raw
			sfc32, sfc64
				tweaked integer seeding to reduce chances of any 2 seeds being nearby in a cycle
			isaac_with_sha2_pool
				removed - if you want something comparable, use sha2_based_pool to seed a faster RNG
			efiix8x256, efiix16x256, efiix32x256, efiix64x256
				renamed to efiix8x384, efiix16x384, efiix32x384, efiix64x384
				tweaked algorithm to improve security
			isaac32x256, isaac64x256
				tweaked implementation to improve speed on some compilers
				changed seeding - now closer to reference algorithm & higher quality
				validation code was added to make sure that this is working correctly
			hc256
				tweaked implementation to improve speed on some compilers
				validation code was added to make sure that this is working correctly
			mwlac64, mwlac32, mwlac16
				removed, for real this time (was supposed to be removed in the prior version)
			mt19937
				validation code was added to make sure that this is working correctly
			lcg64_32
				removed - use xsm32 instead
			clcg96_32
				removed - use xsm64 instead
	documentation:
		added entropy pools documentation
		numerous revisions to old documentation
	example program:
		split example program in to two example programs:
			program 1: RNG_benchmark
				RNG speed testing
			program 2: RNG_output
				specify RNG algorithm by name on the command line
				dump RNG output to stdout
			program 3:
				use statistical tests on an RNGs output
		changed how speed test results are displayed
	new example program:
		multithreaded RNG testing, currently WIN32 only
	tests:
		revised existing transforms:
			lowbits - can now operate on 4 bit units in addition to 8/16/32/64

version 0.84
	RNGs:
		tweaked existing recommended RNGs:
			jsf32 - made more conformant to Robert Jenkins code
			jsf16 -	adjusted constants in jsf16 to improve avalanche properties
			hc256 - fixed two bugs in hc256::walk_state (could cause autoseeding to crash)
		added new recommended RNG:
			sfc16 / sfc32 / sfc64:
				relatively low quality, but very fast and small
				uses only addition, xor, shift, and barrel-shift
				state size is only 3 words
		removed existing recommended RNG:
			mwlac32 / mwlac64:
				Redundant when compared to jsf32/jsf64 to justify inclusion.  
		added new section to full version: "other" aka "NotRecommended"
			these are RNGs that are not recommended for normal usage
			they are intended for evaluating test effectiveness only
			they offer polymorphic implementations only, no raw implementations
