The recommended batteries defined in PractRand are:
"standard" - This is the recommended battery of tests for PractRand.  It is 
	intended to quickly find bias in a wide variety of RNGs.  Some important 
	notes:
	1. This battery actually internally consists of several very closely 
	related batteries, of which one is chosen based upon the output format 
	of the RNG to be tested (determined by checking the metadata).  Each 
	variant puts a little extra effort in to checking the low bits of the 
	RNGs output (because the nature of operations offered on modern 
	computers tends to lead to flaws in the low bits of fast PRNGs).  It 
	must know the output format of the RNG to figure out which bits are the 
	low bits.  
	2. This battery is optimized for efficiency over sensitivity to a much 
	greater degree than other batteries - it is poor at detecting bias on a 
	per-bit basis but makes up for it by being very good at detecting bias on 
	a per-second basis.  
"core" - Not generally recommended.  This is the same as the "standard" 
	battery except that it does not put extra effort in to targeting certain 
	bits.  

Additional batteries are provided by PractRand for the sake of completeness, 
but are not recommended.  Those are:
"extra_foldings" - Not generally recommended.  This is the same as the 
	"standard" battery except that it puts extra effort in to targeting a 
	wide variety of different bits of the output.  
"expanded_core" - Not generally recommended.  This includes the "core" battery 
	plus a bunch of additional tests that were considered inferior to the 
	core tests.  
"expanded_standard" - Not generally recommended.  This includes the 
	"expanded_core" tests, plus it pays extra attention to certain bits of 
	the output, like the "standard" battery.  
"expanded_with_extra_foldings" - Not generally recommended.  This includes 
	the "expanded_standard" battery, but it puts extra effort in to 
	targeting a wide variety of of different bits of the output.
