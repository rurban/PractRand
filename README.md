Practically Random
==================
statistical tests & psuedo- random number generators (RNGs, PRNGs)

Random number generation & testing. The best suite of statistical
tests for fast PRNGs anywhere. Multithreaded for speed, command line
tools for automation, no upper limit on data size. Also, a variety of
C++ pseudo-random number generators with well designed interfaces
aimed at practical uses, not just research.

Features
